# Python-CA-Traffic-Simulation
All the files regarding the cellular automata traffic simulation for the MSc project 2019.

"nagelschr.py" is the inital model created in which was based upon the Nagel and Schreckenberg model with no adaptations.

Files '1DModel.py' and '2DModel.py' are simply the different dimensional versions which run and produce plots and simulations.

"ParaStudy.py" and "Pchange.py" are versions of the 2D plots that are set up to run the parameter sensitivity portion of the project.

The videos are all animations produced by the simulations and their titles describe what they do witha reference to the area of the report they are from.
